# Leveraging Heterogeneous Controller Representations for Evolutionary Swarm Robotics

To understand how to run the code from this paper, you'll need to understand how to run MABE. 
A good starting point for that is the [MABE wiki](https://github.com/Hintzelab/MABE/wiki/)

This paper uses the ForageWorld and ForageOptimizer files, in addtition to the Markov, CGP, and RNN brains.

Follow instructions from the MABE wiki to compile and run code, with configurations for your experiments set in the settings files of the work directory.
